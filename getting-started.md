# Getting started

Welcome to The Modding Tree!

Using the Modding Tree, at its simplest level, just requires getting a copy of it onto your computer.
However, if you do it the right way, it will help in many ways.

Don't let the word "Github" scare you away. It's actually much easier to use than most people think, 
especially because most people use it the hard way. The key is Github Desktop, which lets you do
everything you need to, without even touching the command line. 

The benefits of using Github:
- It makes it much, much easier to update The Modding Tree.
- You can share your work without any extra effort using githack, or with a bit more effort,
    set up a github.io site.
- It lets you undo changes to your code, and to have multiple versions of it.
- It lets you collaborate with other people, if you want to.


# Getting set up with Github and The Modding Tree:

1. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Make a Github account. You can handle this on your own.

3. Log in on your browser, and go back to [The Modding Tree page](https://github.com/Acamaeda/The-Modding-Tree). At the top right,
    there should be a button that says "fork". Click on it, and then on your username.
    You now have your own fork, or copy, of The Modding Tree.

4. Open Github Desktop and log in. Ignore everything else and choose "clone a repository".
    A "repository" is basically a "Github project", like The Modding Tree. "Cloning" is
    downloading a copy of the repository to your computer.

5. Look for The Modding Tree in the list of repositiories (it should be the only one) and click "clone".

6.
