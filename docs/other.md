## CSS
A good way to give your game a unique feel is to customize the appearance of it. Modifying the CSS files helps you to do that on a global level. The CSS is broken up into several files to make it easier to find what is relevant to you.
CSS tip: Every component is automatically given a CSS class with the same name as its layer id. You can use this toapply something specifically for a single layer! You can also combine classes, such as .p.achievement or .c.locked, to change specific things in specific layers.
