# Trees and tree customization

If you want to have something beyond the standard tree on the left tab, you can do that in tree.js. You can change the layout
of the tree, including making non-layer nodes, change it into something other than a tree, or hide the left tab altogether.
This also introduces the "tree" component, which can be used in your layers as well.
